SOLID Principles
================
S - Single Responsibility Principle
------------------------------------
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

O - Open-Closed Principle
-------------------------
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle
---------------------------------
Every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.

I - Interface Segregation Principle
-----------------------------------
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle
----------------------------------
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
